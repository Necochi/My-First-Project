Hello! :>
I'm a newbie in the Web-Developing. In december of 2023 I've just started to learning HTML and CSS
Hope you'll be here watching me develop!

Here I'll tell you a history of me updating this project.

18.12.2023: Fixed some moments like <hr> instead of <div> for the line. Added two blocks of web page

17.12.2023: I've added my project to GitHub. Nothing special, just header and few blocks on the web-page.
