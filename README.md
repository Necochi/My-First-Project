Hello! :>
I'm a newbie in the Web-Developing. In december of 2023 I've just started to learning HTML and CSS
Hope you'll be here watching me develop!

Here I'll tell you a history of me updating this project.

19.12.2023: Web page is ready. Only HTML and CSS. Maybe I'll update it with JS later.

18.12.2023: Fixed some moments in the first few blocks. Added two new blocks of web page.

17.12.2023: I've added my project to GitHub. Nothing special, just header and few blocks on the web-page.
